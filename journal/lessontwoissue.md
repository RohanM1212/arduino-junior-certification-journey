Lesson Two: Quick Break (Hardware Troubleshooting)

I was all set to dive into the math of Ohm’s Law, but I had to take an unexpected detour. Before I could even start the lesson, I realized the Multimeter wasn't working. This made so frustrated because I tried EVERYTHING to get it to work, but the issue was the simplest one. The one I ignored. I learned from this to NEVER rule out the simplest option without trying it. It also makes me upset because I spend hours trying to get it to work because I was in the middle of a lesson. Here is what I did to try and fix it, and what the problem was:

The Multimeter Mystery
When I tried to power on my ANENG DM850, the screen stayed completely blank. The LCD was completely blank which suggested an issue with the power, but I didn't know that at the time. I did get frustrated for a bit but then calmed myself to fix the problem. An frustrated mind is not better than no mind.

My Troubleshooting Steps:

Checking the Connection: I opened the back and made sure the 9V Battery Snap was clicked in tight. It was.

Internal Inspection: I checked the red and black wires inside to make sure no solder joints were broken. They were fine.

The Dial Test: I moved the dial to Continuity and DC Voltage to see if the screen would flicker at all. It didn't flicker at all.

The Research: I read articles online for hours to see if it was some niche problem that a rare few would have. It wasn't a niche problem.

The battery check: I plugged in the battery in the multimeter to my previous circuit to see if it would turn on the LED. It didn't turn on.

The Verdict: Dead on Arrival
It turns out the Kodak battery that came in the box was totally dead. I have to now go to the store just to buy some 9V batteries. I am going to make sure to get at least 4 or 5 of them this time in case some of them are dead out of the box again. I do NOT want to have this issue again. 

Reflection
Even though this was a Quick Break from the actual lesson, it taught me "Mechanical Sympathy". In robotics, you can't just focus on the code or the big ideas. If your power source is dead, nothing else matters. Troubleshooting starts at the very beginning—the battery. I won't be forgetting that ever. From now on every time some tool or part doesn't work as intended, I will be SURE to test the battery first before anything else. I could've avoided wasting so much time if I had just checked the battery first. The main thing that I learned was to make sure the baseline works. Next time I need to make sure all parts work before starting. I will see you again after I get my new set of batteries.

New Vocabulary:
Digital Multimeter – The tool used to measure voltage, current, and resistance.

9V Battery Snap – The connector that "clips" onto a 9V battery to provide power.

DC Voltage (V=) – The type of electricity we use in these projects (Direct Current).

Diagnostic – The process of testing a system to find out exactly why it isn't working.
