Lesson Five (Post Lesson Reflection)

Reaching the capstone project felt different from the earlier lessons. Before this, most of the work felt guided, like I was following steps and learning ideas one at a time. This project forced me to bring everything together at once, and that made it much harder. Instead of just asking “does this work,” I found myself asking “why does this behave this way,” which felt like a shift toward actually engineering something. The goal of the project was to create a holiday light circuit that responded to user input. The requirements were strict: four to eight LEDs, a push button with a pull-down resistor, a potentiometer, and code that used variables and conditional if statements. There were also safety constraints, including keeping the current under 25mA per Arduino pin. I decided to build a “Multi-Mode Holiday Hub” using four LEDs in different colors (red, green, blue, and yellow) so I could clearly see how each color behaved differently in the same circuit.

Parts Used:
Arduino Uno
Breadboard
4 LEDs (red, green, blue, yellow)
4 resistors for the LEDs (537Ω each, measured)
1 push button
1 pull-down resistor (956Ω)
1 potentiometer (10kΩ)
Jumper wires
Multimeter

Writing out the parts list made the project feel more real, because it showed how many individual components had to work together for something that looks simple from the outside.

I started by setting up the power and ground rails on the breadboard. I wanted to make sure everything had a clean and consistent reference point before adding components. While doing this, I was already thinking ahead about troubleshooting, since messy power wiring can make problems harder to track down later. Next, I placed the four LEDs in a straight row. I made a conscious effort to orient them the same way, with all cathodes going to ground, because I had already learned how easy it is to accidentally flip one. Even so, I still managed to wire one LED backward the first time and had to fix it later. Each LED’s anode was connected through a 537Ω resistor to a PWM-capable digital pin (3, 5, 6, and 9). I chose these pins intentionally because I knew I would need PWM to control brightness smoothly rather than just turning the LEDs fully on or off. While wiring the resistors, I kept checking the color codes and confirming resistance values with the multimeter. I did not want to assume they were correct and risk pushing too much current through an LED or an Arduino pin. This step slowed me down, but it made me more confident in the circuit. I then added the potentiometer across the center of the breadboard. The two outer legs were connected to 5V and ground, and the middle leg was connected to analog pin A0. While wiring this, I was thinking about how the Arduino would interpret the changing voltage and how I could reuse that single input for different purposes depending on the current mode. The final wiring step was the push button on digital pin 8 using a pull-down resistor. At first, I underestimated how important the pull-down resistor was. When the button was wired without it, the Arduino switched modes randomly, which made the project feel broken. After measuring voltages and thinking through what “floating” means electrically, I added the pull-down resistor, and the behavior immediately became stable.

When I started writing the code, my first instinct was to treat it like earlier lessons, where the program runs in a straight line. That approach quickly stopped working once I added multiple modes and user input. I realized I needed a way for the Arduino to remember what it was doing at any given time. I created a variable to track the current mode and wrote conditional if statements to determine how the LEDs should behave based on that mode. Every button press increased the mode value, and once it reached the final mode, it looped back to the start. While writing this, I kept thinking about real devices and how a single button can control many settings. One major coding failure involved my use of delay(). I initially used long delays to control blinking and chase speeds, and it technically worked, but the button became unresponsive. At first, I thought the button code was wrong. After testing and thinking about how the processor works, I realized delay() stops everything, including input checks. 
To fix this, I restructured the timing so delays were broken into short intervals while continuously checking the button state. This change made the system feel much more responsive and helped me understand why non-blocking code is important in embedded systems.

I verified the safety of the circuit using a multimeter. The forward voltage of the blue LED was about 2.82V, while the red LED was closer to 1.88V. This made sense once I connected it to the idea that different colors require different energy levels. I measured a voltage drop of about 2.86V across each 537Ω resistor. Using Ohm’s Law:

I = V / R
I = 2.86V / 537Ω ≈ 0.0053A (5.3mA)

This current is well below the Arduino’s recommended limit, which confirmed that the circuit was operating safely.

This project made me realize how much thinking happens between wiring something correctly and making it work well. The circuit technically functioned early on, but it did not feel reliable or responsive until I fixed both hardware and software issues. What stood out most was how much small mistakes mattered. A backwards LED or a poorly placed delay caused problems that were not obvious at first. Fixing those issues forced me to slow down and think about how the system was behaving instead of randomly changing things. I also liked how this project felt more interactive than anything I had done before. Turning a knob and seeing the circuit respond immediately made the Arduino feel less like a programmed object and more like something I was having a conversation with. Even though it was frustrating at times, solving those problems was satisfying and made the project feel meaningful. By the end, I felt more confident in both my wiring and my coding. This was the first project where hardware, software, and math all came together in a way that made sense, and it made me feel more prepared to move forward in the certification. 

We are only half way through the certification. If the math checks out, I will have another project at the end of this certification before I take the test. I will try my best to nake a project better than this one. I honestly love arduino so far there isn't anything to complain about. I just love the idea of creating tangible circuits. It is just so interesting and there is so much to do. I don't think I will ever not want to create circuits. I want to even move on to creating robots. I just wish I could get a teacher or mentor to help me when I need it rather than studying everything by myself. I can do it, but it is much more fun and engaging when I can do it wil peers and teachers.
