Lesson Zero (Post Lesson Reflection)

I received the kit today. I unboxed it, I looked at everything inside. The lesson on the Arduino website gave me a brief overview of the history of Arduino. First it spoke on computers and how early these things came to exist. So wonderful you know? The thing that I am writing this on is a computer but after looking closely at one, it is so complex and beautiful. This Arduino board is part of a small branch of computers called microcontrollers. They are essentially smaller and more compact versions of these computers with simple functions, such as input and output. They can't really do much on their own so that is why they are usually paired with motors to create robots and circuits. Here is what was given in the kit:

Arduino UNO R3/R4 - The thing that will give instructions to everything else
Battery Snap - Used to connect battery with circuit to provide power
Breadboard - Allows for easy connection between wires and circuits
Capacitor - When high voltage, stores electricity and low voltage, release electricity
Jumper Wire - Used to connect motors and components together
Light-Emitting Diode (LED) - Pretty self explanatory, they emit light when powered
Piezo Buzzer - Used to detect vibrations and produce sounds
Phototransistor - Produces a current based on amount of light it sees
Potentiometer - Used to control voltage between three terminals indicated by its pins
Power Lead - Longer jumper wire, usually for power to ground from Arduino to the breadboard
Push Button - Essentially blocks electrical current when off, and allows it to pass when on
Resistor - Resists the flow of electricity depending on number and color of bands on it
Servo Motor - Can rotate a maximum of 180 degrees based on electrical pulses from the Arduino
USB Cable - Used to connect the Arduino and a computer to code and provide power to the Arduino

Along with this, we were given a orange board with a lot of cutouts on it. I was tasked to remove the cutouts, screw the Arduino on the board, and stick the breadboard to it to create what they called the Project Board (refer to the unboxing_and_base_setup.jpg image in media).

Also, to code the Arduino, I will be using a software called Arduino IDE. Very surprising I know. After all of this, I was tasked to take a test from the logbook that was given to us. The logbook contains mainly assessments and notes for each lesson. For the safety quiz, I scored a 100% teaching me:

Electricity can cause shocks, burns, nerve damage, and irregular heartbeat.
When working with circuits, make sure to NOT work on a metal surface, have an open beverage nearby, work with power supplied to the circuit, and wear metal jewelry.
If a person is being shocked by a circuit, the first thing you should do is turn off the circuit. 
Supply power to the circuit only when it is finished.
If an electrical component is damaged, replace it.

This is lesson zero of the Arduino certification course which I will complete and then hopefully become certified.
