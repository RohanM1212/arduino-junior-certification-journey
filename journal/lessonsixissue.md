Lesson Six Quick Break (Missing Component)

Lesson six was on capacitators, a new component. It was actually quite interesting to learn about it in the lesson but when it came time to start the wiring, there was no capacitator to be found. I genuinely turned the whole kit into a mess trying to find a capacitator, but it turns out there was no capacitator. This is the second time I've had an issue in this journey, so I wasn't to frustrated. Of course I couldn't skip the lesson, my certification was going to have this topic on it. I still will be able to use a multimeter, but I won't get the experience of using a capacitator in real life. I also checked and found out that my next lesson uses a capacitator as well so I don't think that lesson will be in person either. Luckily, the ones after don't use a capacitator so I can complete lessons 8, 9, and 10 in real life. It really was a bummer that I had to look for alternate ways to finish this lesson. Let me tell you everything I had to do to fix the issue, and it wasn't fun.

Troubleshooting Steps:

Trying to find the component: I emptied the whole box and spent an hour making sure everything that I put back into the box wasn't a capacitator. By the time I was done, every piece that I had taken out of the box was right back in it, but in a mess. Of course, I let out a groan of frustration but didn't give up quite just yet. 

Box destruction: The next step in my madness was to tear apart the box the kit came in just in case they kept it outside the kit. That was, of course, very  unlikely. I tore the box apart and looked at every part of the cardboard, making sure I didn't miss a spot, to see if there was a hidden component. There was nothing there other than more cardboard.

Double-checking the label: I went back into the box to find it's list of parts. I went in there and tried to find anywhere where it states that this kit doesn't have a capacitator or some essential information such as that. There wasn't any information, but I did confirm that there was supposed to be a capacitator. 

Research online: I finally accepted the fact that there was no capacitator to be found and just decided to find a website which will allow me to create circuits online. I accepted my defeat. Never thought I would see a day where I would be defeated by a capacitator.

The Verdict: Tinkercad came to the rescue.
I found this software called Tinkercad and it has all sorts of components and microcontrollers. It has everything I need for my next two lessons as well so I think I will use this for my next two lessons. I will miss the experience of wiring the capacitator in real life but it is ok. I will definitely write down my experiences with Tinkercad and if I recommend using it or not, but I'm still pretty ticked off about this whole situation. Still, it was better than my last issue where I had to wait to continue my work.

Reflection
Even though this was a Quick Break from the physical build, it taught me about something called Agile/Adaptive Engineering. In the real world, you don't always have the parts you need at hand at all times. You can't just stop the whole project and wait for a shipment because of this. Using TinkerCad as a replacement to my real life components helped me realize the capacitor's behavior, how it stores a charge and slowly lets it out, without needing the physical part in my hand. I learned that an engineer's best tool isn't always their screwdriver, sometimes it's their ability to adapt. I am sad I couldn't make the circuit in real life, but I’m happy I didn’t let a missing part stop my progress and find a new website that could potentially be a great tool in the future.

New Vocabulary:

Capacitor – A component that stores electrical energy temporarily.

100µF (Microfarads) – The measurement of how much charge this specific capacitor can hold.

Digital Twin – A virtual model of a physical object that allows you to test things without having the parts in front of you.

Polarity – The direction of the flow of electricity in the component. I learned that capacitors have a long leg and a short leg and they HAVE to go in the right way or they won't work. If the electricity doesn't flow in the right direction, the component will not function properly.
